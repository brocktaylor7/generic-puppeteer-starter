# Generic Puppeteer Starter

This is a generic puppeteer starter repo that opens a webpage. It also has some basic mechanisms built in for handling libraries that need access to the puppeteer page.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll want to run `yarn install`. Once the dependencies are installed, you can run `yarn build` to build the code, and `yarn start` to launch the process.
